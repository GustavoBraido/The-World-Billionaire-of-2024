## Excel/Tableau Project

### AIM: Analyse the world's richest individuals to uncover trends and patterns in wealth creation and distribution.

Data: Kaggle - Richest People in the World 2024

### [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divanshu22/richest-people-in-the-world-2024)

In this project, I'm analyzing factors like industry, country, age, and gender, as well as primary sources of wealth like inheritance, entrepreneurship, and investments.

The goal is to identify significant trends and correlations that can inform wealth management strategies, economic policymaking, and investment opportunities.

To implement these strategies effectively, I'm presenting compelling analysis and actionable recommendations to stakeholders, financial institutions, and investors.

The outcome of this analysis will be a data-driven approach to understanding and leveraging the trends in wealth creation among the world's richest individuals.

Data: Rank, Billionaire Name, Net Worth, Company, Age, Gender, Country and Region.

Using a data collection that I previously cleaned in **Excel**, I generated a dashboard with the following parameters:

1- Global Distribution of Billionaires by Country

3- Leading Industries Shaping the World's Wealthiest: Top 30 Billionaire-Breeding Sectors

2- Regional Breakdown of the World's Billionaire Population

4- Unveiling Wealth Across Generation 

5- Gender Distribution Among the World's Billionaires 

6- Gender Distribution of Billionaires by Age Group
