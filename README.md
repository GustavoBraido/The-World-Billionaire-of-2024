The World Billionaires of 2024 is a Tableau dashboard that visualizes the global wealth distribution among billionaires, providing insights into demographics, regional distribution, and industry affiliations, offering a comprehensive view of global wealth concentration.

## Excel/Tableau Project

### AIM: Analyse the world's richest individuals to uncover trends and patterns in wealth creation and distribution.

### [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divanshu22/richest-people-in-the-world-2024)  Kaggle - Richest People in the World 2024

In this project, I analyze factors like industry, country, age, and gender, as well as primary sources of wealth like inheritance, entrepreneurship, and investments.

The goal is to identify significant trends and correlations that can inform wealth management strategies, economic policymaking, and investment opportunities.

To implement these strategies effectively, I'm presenting compelling analysis and actionable recommendations to stakeholders, financial institutions, and investors.

The outcome of this analysis will be a data-driven approach to understanding and leveraging the trends in wealth creation among the world's richest individuals.

Data: Rank, Billionaire Name, Net Worth, Company, Age, Gender, Country and Region.

Using a data collection that I previously cleaned in **Excel**, I generated a dashboard with the following parameters:

1- Global Distribution of Billionaires by Country

3- Leading Industries Shaping the World's Wealthiest: Top 30 Billionaire-Breeding Sectors

2- Regional Breakdown of the World's Billionaire Population

4- Unveiling Wealth Across Generation 

5- Gender Distribution Among the World's Billionaires
